# optimized-search-engine

## Description

-A marketing agency client wants a codebase that follows accessible standards, so that their website is optimized for search engines. 

## Problem

-As a web developer, some issues of the original website that I found were :
 -the contents of the original website was not aligned to the ideal standard formatting. 
 -The navigation did not function properly because it did not direct to its desired destination.

 ## Solution 

 -I solved some errors on the CSS format by making some changes with the display and positioning attributes. Mainly aligning the box contents to its ideal standard to make it look more presentable.
- I aligned the logo and the navigation in the same content and made sure the display attribute was set to inline block.
